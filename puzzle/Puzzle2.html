<p>Let&#8217;s examine how to swap things.</p>

<p>We all remember learning swapping from cs1 when we were learning some type of sorting algorithm - swapping allowed us to sort arrays in place (constant space) rather than constructing a new array.</p>

<p>It goes something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>int temp = array[0];
array[0] = array[1];
array[1] = temp;
</code></pre>

<p>Boom-eth! Thou art impressed with my swapping-eth of array positions <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Hmm. As it turns out, I&#8217;m not impressed. Not at all. What if I don&#8217;t want to use these intermediary variables like <code>temp</code>? After all, if you needed to use extra memory, is it <em>really</em> in place?</p>

<p>How would you do this without that variable?</p>

<p>If you guessed bit-wise operations, you&#8217;d be right. In this case, we&#8217;ll use the exclusive-or (xor) operator <code>^</code>.</p>

<p>Xor has two key properties:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Anything xor-ed with <code>0</code> is itself</p></li>
<li><p>Anything xor-ed with itself is <code>0</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So how would we do it?</p>

<pre><code>int a = 5;
int b = 4;

b ^= a;
a ^= b;
b ^= a;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Huh</em>? That&#8217;s it? Yes, that&#8217;s it. Let&#8217;s take a look as to what&#8217;s going on here.</p>

<p><code>b ^= a</code> expands to <code>b = b ^ a</code>. So now <code>b = 4 ^ 5</code>, and <code>a = 5</code>.</p>

<p>The second statement <code>a = a ^ b</code> expands to <code>a = 5 ^ 4 ^ 5</code>. Using the above two properties, that simpliefies down to <code>a = 4 ^ 5 ^ 5 = 4 ^ 0 = 4</code>. So now, <code>a  = 4</code>.</p>

<p>The final statement then simplifies to <code>b = 4 ^ 5 ^ 4 = 5 ^ 0 = 5</code>.</p>

<p>And we&#8217;ve successfully swapped the two integers!</p>
