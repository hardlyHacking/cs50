<h2 id="alookback">A Look Back</h2>

<p>This term has been incredibly hectic, and despite a remarkably rough, shorter than average quarter, you&#8217;ve written a large chunk of code base! In just several short weeks, you&#8217;ve written an entire search engine. Look back on the volume of code &#8211; roughly 4000 lines or so! That&#8217;s quite a feat.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve learned</p>

<ul>
<li>Unix / Command line workflow</li>
<li>Bash scripting</li>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Proper documentation habits</li>
<li>Coding defensively</li>
<li>A whole lot about C!</li>
</ul>

<p>This course is not designed to be an easy one; it&#8217;s a grueling amount of work, and you&#8217;ve all done spectacularly well. Now that you&#8217;ve taking this class, you&#8217;re ready for a whole new world of upper level CS courses.</p>

<h2 id="thefuture">The Future</h2>

<p>So where do we go from here?</p>

<p>Now that you know C, you&#8217;re ready to really blow the lid on this horrifying abstraction and find out what&#8217;s <em>really</em> going on in your computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs51/">Computer Architecture</a> - Computer Architecture is a really phenomenal way to understand the inner workings of how your computer operates. How <em>do</em> all those <code>0</code>&#8217;s and <code>1</code>&#8217;s translate into computer operations? This is the heart of computer architecture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs60/">Computer Networks</a> - How does the Internet work? As it turns out, C is the magic glue that holds everything together, and now that you have a solid grasp of this glue, you&#8217;re ready to build your very own version of the Internet!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs58/">Operating Systems</a> - You&#8217;ve all used operating systems, and you all have <em>some</em> idea of what Operating Systems do. But how do they work? In this course, you&#8217;ll build your very own Operating System.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs57/">Compilers</a> - How does a language work? How is GCC implemented? Write your own stripped-down version of a C compiler and find out!</p>

<h2 id="finalwords">Final Words</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve enjoyed working with all of you. The wonderful thing about upper level CS classes is that students have more of the Hacker Spirit. You&#8217;re willing to grind through incredibly difficult problems and stretch your mind. You&#8217;re willing to learn. Despite hours of debugging insane <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">Heisenbugs</a> with threads of inexplicable <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky abstractions</a>, you did not go running to lab hours begging for help. I&#8217;ve seen countless cases of students only approaching me after hours of debugging and perseverence.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve been a fantastic class, and you&#8217;ve made being a section leader seem more like fun than work (perhaps not for those that actually had to deal with me <code>;)</code>). Best of luck in all your future endeavors!</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Sometime, one day when you&#8217;re bored perhaps, I do hope you read the class assignments on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel&#8217;s blog</a>. It is a fantastic read and he is a great writer.</p>
